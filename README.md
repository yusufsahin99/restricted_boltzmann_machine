# Restricted Boltzmann Machine
A PyTorch implementation of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine used for movie recommendation.

The model was trained and tested in [MovieLens 1M Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/) using various numbers of hidden units and batch sizes.

The changes in loss function throughout the training can be seen in the plot.
